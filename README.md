# Flask-Docker-Traffic-Balancer
This project demonstrates how to build and dockerize two simple Flask applications, then use Docker Compose to deploy and manage them with traffic load balancing. The setup leverages a load balancer (configured via Nginx or HAProxy) to distribute traffic across the Flask services, providing a scalable and efficient microservices architecture.
